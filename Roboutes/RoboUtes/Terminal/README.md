# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

This will house the Terminal application, this will be universal for every user.  They will only need this application to operate any of the terminals.

### How do I get set up? ###

This should be cloned to /RoboUtes/Terminal folder in order to ensure proper references.

Once in Visual Studio, in order to build a new release, place into release mode, Costura Fody will pack the exe with all needed dll's, so you will only need Terminal.exe for client usage.

### Contribution guidelines ###

This should only be distributed to RoboUtes members, and should only be modified by the CS team within RoboUtes.

### Who do I talk to? ###

If you need any assistance, please speak with Damon.
